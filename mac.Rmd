# Biogeochemistry data analyses

The central dogma of biology (DNA -> RNA -> protein (-> metabolites)) is a shared genetic code that can be leveraged to answer many of our questions about the organic molecules produced by microbial metabolisms. Like most of my peers, I have learned different bioinformatic tools as needed to answer my science questions from friends and other publicly available tools. On my github I post not only my codes, but also annotated files that I hope are interpretable to any new and eager learner. I also include some useful resources below that I often use myself.
