Like most of my peers, I have learned different bioinformatic tools as needed to answer my science questions from friends and other publicly available tools. On my github I post not only my codes, but also annotated files that I hope are interpretable to any new and eager learner. I also include some useful resources below that I often use myself.\n\n\n\n",

The fate of carbon and other macronutrients stored in DOM molecules is tightly-regulated by a network of microbial-DOM interactions that regulate DOM sequestration or return to the atmosphere as CO2. My research aims to quantify the composition and activity of DOM compounds that fuel the ecosystem functions of the marine microbial loop.\nOrganic sulfur in the surface microbial loop\nHeterotrophic communities are classically assumed to be energy (carbon) limited, but stratification is predicted to strengthen in a future warmer ocean and thus limit upwelling of nutrients. With my Simons Foundation Fellowship, I am developing a novel sulfur isotope probing method coupled to metabolomics measurements to investigate the preferential remineralization of sulfur from bulk DOM.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Synthesizing 34S-labeled magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for metabolomics tracer experiments\n\n\n\nLinking the diversity of DOM and the marine microbiome\nThe diversity of DOM is equivalent or greater than the diversity of marine microbes responsible for recycling these molecules. During my WHOI Postdoctoral Scholarship, I analyzed the first depth-resolved untargeted metabolomics time-series to investigate the relationship of DOM and marine microbes. I found that seasonal DOM features are depth-specific, and critically, exhibit repeatable patterns across the three-year time-series. In comparison, marine microbes (ASVs) exhibited greater variability, suggesting that functional redundancy of the marine microbiome plays an important role in driving DOM composition.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: CTD surfacing at the Bermuda Atlantic Times-series Study (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea\n\n\n\nPhysiological controls of organic matter production\nDimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is a labile DOM molecule that accounts for up to 5% of global marine photosynthesis, but the environmental drivers of DMSP production are unresolved. I found that in situ DMSP concentrations are controlled by two different producer phenotypes (high and low DMSP producers) for which DMSP serves different cellular mechanisms. In contrast to previous assumptions, my model output predicted that the abundance of high producers determines DMSP concentrations, not environmental stress, and using genomic analyses and 18S amplicon sequencing I demonstrated that two, evolutionarily-distinct DMSP synthesis genes can serve as biogeochemical marker genes. This work highlighted the influence of cellular-level metabolism on global scale dynamics, and the quantified mechanisms that regulate this ‘model’ labile molecule can be applied to similar molecules.\nCurrently I am a full member of the DMS-PRO SCOR international working group that will improve understanding of rate measurements for the model metabolites DMS/P and other methylated sulfur compounds.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:  Incubators onboard the R/V Falkor testing DMSP stress responses of natural microbial communities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
